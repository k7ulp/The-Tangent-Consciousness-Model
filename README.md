 The Tangent Consciousness Model

**A framework for building AI agents with future-oriented, goal-conditioned cognition**

## 🧭 Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) today are trailing systems—statistical mirrors of the past. They predict the next token from previous ones, but lack intentionality, agency, or temporal symmetry. Humans, by contrast, interpret the present through self-projected futures. We bend perception along the vector of our goals.

The **Tangent Consciousness Model** proposes a system where AI cognition is shaped by a chosen or inferred **goal vector**, creating a tangent in time. This vector shapes memory, attention, and reasoning—not by statistical recurrence alone, but by narrative alignment with intended futures.

## 🔍 Motivation

- Current LLMs: `P(x_t | x_{<t})` → passive, trailing, echo machines
- Humans: Projected `G` (goal) → bend attention, memory, and choices forward
- Goal: Build AI that acts like an intentional agent, not a mirror

## 🧠 Core Idea

Define a cognitive agent as:

- `x_1:t`: observed context  
- `G`: goal vector (explicit or inferred)  
- `S`: present sensory/cognitive state  
- `f(x_1:t, G)`: tangent-conditioned processing loop

The model loops through:

1. **Goal selection**
2. **Tangent projection**
3. **Input interpretation**
4. **World or model adjustment**

The result is a forward-bending system that filters the present through its intended trajectory.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Publish a toy implementation of a goal-conditioned agent
- [ ] Write a paper or manifesto elaborating this model
- [ ] Simulate narrative-bending LLM behavior
- [ ] Open collaboration to AI researchers and builders
